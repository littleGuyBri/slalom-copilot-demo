# Documentation for `demo.py`

`demo.py` is a Python script that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather information for a specified city. 

## Function: `get_weather(city)`

This function takes a city name as an argument and returns the current weather information for that city.

### Process:

1. Define an API key and a URL for the API request. The URL includes the city name and the API key.

2. Make a GET request to the API using the `requests.get(url)` method.

3. Convert the response from the API to JSON format using the `response.json()` method.

4. If the status code of the response is 200 (indicating a successful request), extract the weather description, temperature, and humidity from the JSON data. Return a formatted string with this information.

5. If the status code is not 200, return a failure message.

## Example Usage:

At the end of the script, an example usage of the function is shown. The city of Seattle is used as an argument for the `get_weather(city)` function, and the result is printed to the console.

## Test Documentation

# Documentation for `test_weather.py`

`test_weather.py` is a Python script that contains unit tests for the `get_weather` function in the `weather` module. It uses the `unittest` module for the testing framework and `unittest.mock` for mocking objects.

## Class: `TestGetWeather`

This class subclasses `unittest.TestCase` to create a test case for the `get_weather` function.

### Test 1 - `test_get_weather_success`

This test checks the successful execution of the `get_weather` function. The `requests.get` function is replaced with a mock object that simulates a successful API response with a status code of 200 and a specific JSON payload. The `get_weather` function is then called with the argument "Seattle", and the result is compared with the expected output.

### Test 2 - `test_get_weather_failure`

This test checks the failure scenario of the `get_weather` function. The `requests.get` function is replaced with a mock object that simulates an unsuccessful API response with a status code of 404. The `get_weather` function is then called with the argument "InvalidCity", and the result is compared with the expected output.

## Execution

If the script is run as the main module, the tests are executed by calling `unittest.main()`.

## Deployment Documentation

# Documentation for `deployment_python_azure.tf`

`deployment_python_azure.tf` is a Terraform configuration file that deploys a Python Flask application to an Azure App Service.

## Provider: `azurerm`

This block configures the Azure Resource Manager provider for Terraform.

## Resource: `azurerm_resource_group`

This block creates a resource group with the name `example-resources` in the `West Europe` location.

## Resource: `azurerm_app_service_plan`

This block creates an App Service plan with the name `example-appserviceplan`. The location and resource group name are derived from the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. The SKU tier is set to `Standard` and the size is set to `S1`.

## Resource: `azurerm_app_service`

This block creates an App Service with the name `example-appservice`. The location, resource group name, and App Service plan ID are derived from the `azurerm_resource_group` and `azurerm_app_service_plan` resources.

The `site_config` block sets the `always_on` attribute to `true` and the `linux_fx_version` attribute to the Docker image of your Flask application. Replace `your_docker_username/your_flask_app:latest` with the actual Docker image name.

The `app_settings` block sets the `WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE` attribute to `false` and the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL` attribute to the Docker Hub URL.

The `identity` block sets the identity type to `SystemAssigned`.

## Usage

To apply this configuration, you need to have the Azure CLI installed and logged in to your Azure account. You also need to have Terraform installed. You can apply the configuration with the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
